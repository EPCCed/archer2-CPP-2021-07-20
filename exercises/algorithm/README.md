# Algorithm use exercise

In the file `ex.cpp` there is an incomplete program which, by

You will likely want to refer to the documentation of the standard
library algorithms, which, for reasons, are split across two headers:

- <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm>

- <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric#Numeric_algorithms>
