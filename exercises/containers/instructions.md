# Containers exercise

In your clone of this repository, find the `containers` exercise and list
the files

```
$ cd archer2-CPP-2021-07-20/exercises/containers
$ ls
Makefile	test.cpp	vector_ex.cpp	vector_ex.hpp
```

As before, `test.cpp` holds some basic unit tests.

`vector_ex.cpp`/`.hpp` hold some functions that work on `std::vector` - provide the implementations

The tests require that you implement, in a new header/implementation
pair of files, a function to add a string to a `std::map` as the key,
the value being the length of the string.

You will want to find the documentatation for `map` on https://en.cppreference.com/

You can compile with `make` as before.
